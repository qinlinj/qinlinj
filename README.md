Hello! I'm Justin Jia. My fascination with software development feels akin to constructing vast new worlds in Minecraft - a process of turning simple blocks into complex, vibrant landscapes. Crafting blocks of code into functioning, cloud-based solutions captivates me in much the same way.

üéì Educational Foundation:
Recently graduating with a Master's from Carnegie Mellon University and a Bachelor's from the joint program between Beijing Jiaotong University & Rochester Institute of Technology.

üå± Life Beyond the Screen:
Beyond my technical pursuits, I find joy in experimenting with culinary recipes, a testament to my love for exploration and creativity. This enthusiasm for trying new things fuels my professional work, encouraging me to constantly seek innovative solutions.

üíº Skills & Aspirations:
Java, SQL, Python, Spark, and an array of modern web development tools. Especially drawn to cloud computing platforms like AWS.

ü§ù Open to Collaboration:
As a fresh graduate, I'm keen on joining a team as a Java Full-Stack Software Development Engineer, bringing not only my technical expertise but also a lifelong passion for crafting innovative solutions. If you're looking for someone who is always ready to co-innovate and help shape the future of technology, let's connect and start paving the way to tomorrow's digital landscape together.
