Hello! I'm Justin Jia. My fascination with software development feels akin to constructing vast new worlds in Minecraft - a process of turning simple blocks into complex, vibrant landscapes. Crafting blocks of code into functioning, cloud-based solutions captivates me in much the same way. This pursuit, blending creativity with technical skill, has been my passion for as long as I can remember. It's the thrill of creation and problem-solving that drives my interest in technology.

üéì Educational Foundation:
Recently graduating with a Master's from Carnegie Mellon University and a Bachelor's from the joint program between Beijing Jiaotong University & Rochester Institute of Technology, my academic background spans vital areas like computer systems, machine learning, and web development.

üöÄ Project Experience:
My journey has led me to work on notable projects such as developing a fatigue detection system for TCS and a scalable Twitter analytics service. These opportunities have underscored the importance of creating scalable, impactful technological solutions. My internships at DeFiner Labs and Trip.com further refined my skills in web development, data infrastructure and the intricacies of the decentralized web.

üå± Life Beyond the Screen:
Beyond my technical pursuits, I find joy in experimenting with culinary recipes, a testament to my love for exploration and creativity. This enthusiasm for trying new things fuels my professional work, encouraging me to constantly seek innovative solutions.

üíº Skills & Aspirations:
I come armed with a diverse skill set that includes Java, SQL, Python, Spark, and an array of modern web development tools. I am especially drawn to cloud computing platforms like AWS, aiming to harness these technologies to develop powerful and versatile web applications.

ü§ù Open to Collaboration:
As a fresh graduate, I'm keen on joining a team as a Java Full-Stack Software Development Engineer, bringing not only my technical expertise but also a lifelong passion for crafting innovative solutions. If you're looking for someone who is always ready to co-innovate and help shape the future of technology, let's connect and start paving the way to tomorrow's digital landscape together.
